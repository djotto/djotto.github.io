            <h4>George Wills (1848-1927)</h4>
            <p>
                George Wills was born in 1848 in Wells, Somerset to James and Eleanor Wills. His father was a horse dealer.

                He operated as an art and antiques dealer in Bath, Bristol and London, collected old Wedgwood (and other antiques), retired in 1919 and died in 1927.

                He married Georgina Elliott, whose brother Philip Elliott and nephew <a href="https://antiquetrade.leeds.ac.uk/people/37821">John P. Way</a> were both in the trade.

                In London he was in partnership with <a href="https://antiquetrade.leeds.ac.uk/people/37696">Elias Simmons</a> as <a href="https://antiquetrade.leeds.ac.uk/dealerships/36273">Wills & Simmons</a>.

                He and Georgina had four children who survived into adulthood and both his sons, John and George, worked in the trade.

            <blockquote>George Wills operated from 49 Park Street and lived at 57 Park Street (unless he moved between
                1891 and 1893). John P Way operated and lived at 69 Park Street until 1912, when he moved to 41 Park
                Street. Philip Elliott also operated from somewhere on Park Street. It would be interesting to hit up
                Kellys and see exactly how many antiques dealers there were on that street, and if any more were
                related to the Elliott family.</blockquote>
