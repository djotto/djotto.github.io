					<p>"BATTLE OF MINDEN."</p>
					<p>A well-known inn and coaching house at Hilsea which has long since disappeared. It used to
					boast a signboard painted by Sir Robert Kerporter. About the middle of the 18th Century it
					gained unenviable notoriety, its proprietor, Samuel James Lewis, being robbed and murdered by
					a sergeant of the Royal Marines, named Williams, who was tried at Winchester, convicted,
					and hanged on Southsea Common in 1768. His gibbeted body was taken down and buried secretly
					by his comrades, the mystery of its disappearance being solved 20 years later, when the remains
					were found during some excavations on the fortifications.</p>

					<p>WEDNESDAY, Dec. 9.</p>
					<p>Extract of a letter from Portsmouth, Dec. 6.</p>
					<p>"On Wednesday night last as Mrs. Lewis, who keeps a Public-house, the sign of the Battle of Minden,
						at Hilsea near Portsmouth, was going to-bed, she discovered the feet of a man under the bed. Her
						maid and children lay in the same room; one of the children cried for beer, which proved a very
						lucky circumstance for her; alarmed as she was, she had nevertheless the presence of mind
						to pretend not to take any notice of what she saw, but fondly desired the child to lie still and
						she would draw her some beer. She immediately went down stairs, slipt out of doors, went over to a
						farm-house opposite, and after alarming them acquainted them with the circumstance. The Farmer
						and three of his men arming themselves went over with her, and found a man under the bed with
						a razor open in his hand; they instantly secured him, and the next morning carried him before a
						Justice of Peace, who committed him to Winchester gaol. Thus providentially did this woman
						and three innocent children escape from being all murdered. What is remarkable is, that this
						woman's husband was shot about five years ago two miles from Portsmouth, as he was going home,
						by one Williams, who was executed for the murder, and is hanging in chains on South Sea common."</p>

					<p>The stockading of the glacis of Southsea is undergoing a repair, and on Wednesday last a human
					scull and some other bones were dug up near the bathing machines: they lay scarcely two inches
					below the surface, and are supposed to be the bones of one Williams, a sergeant of the marines,
					who was convicted on the evidence of an accomplice, and also a sergeant of the marines, named
					Grant, about the year 1758, of the murder of a man of property near the Battle of Minden
					public-house, at Hilsea. Williams was tried at Winchester, and it being clearly proved that he,
					in company with Grant, shot the man dead off his horse and plundered him, and his watch having
					been traced to Williams, opened the whole affair, and he was accordingly sentenced to be hung
					and gibbetted at the bathing machines, Southsea Common, which was accordingly executed; but some
					time after the body was taken down in the night from the gibbet, supposed by the Marines, who
					much respected him before his crime, and privately buried him in some adjacent spot, which render
					it more than probable that those bones were Williams's.</p>

						An inquest was held at the Coach and Horses at Hilsea, near Portsmouth, by Mr Longcroft, on the
						body of Jonas Over, of Easton, near this city, found dead on Monday in a field of standing oats
						at Hilsea, about 100 yards from a footpath leading from Cosham to Landport. The body, from its
						advanced state of decomposition, exhibited a sad and distressing spectacle, having lain in the
						situation in which it was found ten or eleven days. The poor fellow had been engaged for some
						weeks on the premises of Mr. Baker at Wymering but had completed and left his work there on the
						1st of June and had since been employed at the erection of some new buildings at Cosham, and
						was last seen there on the 13th inst. No direct evidence appearing as to the cause of his death,
						a verdict of <i>Found Dead</i> was returned, and the body interred the same evening in
						Wymering church-yard. Whatever may have occasioned the death of the poor fellow, there is reason
						to hope, from the easy position in which the body was found, that it was occasioned by no act of
						violence.</p>

					commenced kicking in a fearful manner and the unfortunate man received a kick which broke one of
					his legs, and severely injured the other. He was conveyed to the Coach and Horses, near which

					<p>Did this sale ever take place? Lucy Neat continues running the business until at least October
						1863, but presumably she  came close to abandoning/losing it after her husband died. By 1881 she
						is living at Wymering Road Alms House, and she dies in 1890.</p>

					<p>William Brown, brickmaker, of No. 2, Kingston-road, Buckland, said he knew the two prisoners.
					On Monday, the 17th inst., about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, he saw them at Mr. Allen's
					beershop. Singleton called him in and asked him to have half a pint of beer, which he did. He saw
					a quantity of gold in Singleton's hand; he could not say how much. He did not see any silver; it
					was all gold. McGhie paid for one pot of beer with a sixpence. Singleton hired a cart at Allen's
					of a man named Benham. He did not hear what they said; they went outside and hired the cart and
					he remained inside. They left together, but neither of them got into the cart at that time. When
					they got a little way along the road, they asked him (witness) to have some brandy, and they went
					into Mr Hayward's, the White Swan, and had half a pint of brandy, which McGhie paid for with a
					shilling and two-pence. They then went to the Blue Anchor, at Kingston-cross, kept by Mr. Churcher,
					and there they had a pint of brandy; Singleton called two men in and they had some of the brandy;
					and he went and got a loaf and some cheese and gave it to them. The men were strangers. They then
					went to the Sportsman, and the two men went with them. There they had two pots of beer. Witness
					then went home to breakfast, and Singleton went away in a cart. He did not see which way McGhie
					went; he did not see him afterwards. This was about 10 o'clock.</p>
					<p>Cross-examined: He didn't know that they called this "going on a spree." He did not know whether
					it was a practie for men like the prisoners and himself to go about like this before breakfast; he
					never went with them before. He had a "drop" at his own work,and with other men at times. He was not
					aware that Singleton was a general dealer.</p>
					<p>Edward Albert Philip Cleife, a bricklayer, residing at 7, Buckland-street, said that on Monday,
					the 17th inst., he drove a cart for Mr Benham, which had been hired by Singleton. He took him up at
					Kingston-cross about 10 o'clock in the morning, and drove him to Gravel Hill, a distance of about
					14 miles. On the road he frequently stopped at publichouses; he should think four or five times.
					At the Leopard at Purbrook he called for some beer and brandy and treated the men in the tap-room.
					He did not know how much brandy he had, but he had one pint. He stopped at the Coach and Horses at
					Hilsea; witness had a bottle of ginger beer, and Singleton had some beer and treated a man who
					worked there. He recollected the George at Portsdown Hill; Singleton had some beer there, and
					treated some beer to any one who liked to have it. He also stopped at Horndean, and there he had
					half a gallon of beer, and half a pint of brandy. When they got to Gravel Hill they had half a
					pint of brandy. Singleton paid Mr. Benham for the horse and trap, and gave witness half a
					sovereign in addition to this for himself.</p>

					<p>AFFILIATION SUMMONS&mdash;James Rappe, a driver on the Portsmouth Tramways, of 64, Emanuel-street,
					Landport, was summoned to show cause why an order should not be made on him for the support of the
					illegitimate child of Eliza Collins, of the Coach and Horses, Hilsea, of which she alleged him to be
					the father.&mdash;Mr. Wainscot appeared in support of the complainant, and Mr. Feltham for
					defendant.&mdash;After a lengthy hearing, in which the evidence was of a most contradictory nature,
					the Bench dismissed the summons for want of corroborative evidence.</p>

					<p>CREDITORS' MEETINGS.</p>
					<p>CURIOUS CASE OF THE "COACH AND HORSES."</p>
					<p>THE LEASE OF A FREE HOUSE.</p>
					<p>The first meeting of the creditors of Edward Hind, licensed victualler, of the "Coach and Horses,"
					Hilsea, was held at the Official Receiver's office, Portsmouth, this afternoon.</p>
					<p>The liabilities amounted to £310 17s. 9d., and the assets totalled £27 14s. 5d., leaving a
					deficiency of £283 3s. 4d. The failure was attributed to insufficient turn-over in business and
					increased assessments.</p>
					<p>The Official Receiver's statement showd that the debtor was originally a commercial traveller
					in tea, but gave up this calling in favour of an off-license business. Having saved £120, in 1897
					he took over the "Coach and Horses," Hilsea, from the War Department, the lease, by consent of
					the War Department, being held by the United Brewery Company, who found the purchase money.
					The rates had increased from £42 to £152 while he was tenant of the house, and he had lost about
					£120 in the business.</p>
					<p>The chief debtors were:&mdash;Portsmouth United Breweries' Company, £176 15s. 8d.; Mr. B.
					Murtough, £25 6s. 1d.; Mr. Miller, tobacconist, £16 16s. 1d.; Meyhew and Arnold, £14 2s. 6d.;
					and Mr. Rose, £10 16s. 9&frac12;d.</p>
					<p>The Official Receiver said that the United Breweries Company paid £1,400 for the lease, and
					with the consent of the War Office took the lease on mortgage. It was a remarkable fact in this case
					that the house was supposed to be a free one. Yet in the lease the brewers were allowed to
					become mortgagees, and the brewers, he pointed out, were always ready to tie a house. A quesiton
					was whether the lease was void, because it contained a bankruptcy clause.</p>
					<p>Mr. Franckeiss (who appeared for the Brewery Company) said he had looked through the lease,
					and there was no bankruptcy clause.</p>
					<p>The Official Receiver pointed out that that removed a difficulty from the case. He went on to
					suggest that the house should either be advertised or handed over to the United Breweries' Co.</p>
					<p>Mr. Murtough thought the latter course would be the best, and it was ultimately agreed to.</p>

					<p>I believe Mr. B. Murtough to be Bernard Murtough, mineral water manufacturer, who would have been
					~67 at the time of the creditors' meeting. I have a photograph of the Coach and Horses (not yet

					<h2>Morning Post</h2>
					<span class="cd-timeline__date">Friday 20 March, 1908</span>
					<p><img src="1908/BL_0000174_19080320_096_0005.png"/></p>
					<p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING POST</p>
					<p>SIR,&mdash;I and other Members of Parliament received a circular dated March 12 and signed
						"W. T. Dupree," in which the following statement was made with regard to the Coach and Horses
						at Hilsea:</p>
					<p>"I have had this property valued (minus the licence) by three of the principal firms of
					valuers in Portsmouth, with the following results: Messrs. Hall, Pain, and Goldsmith (the Government
					agents who sold the property), £2,500; Messrs. King and King, £1,950; and Messrs. Low and Cooper,
					£2,000; giving an average of £2,150as the value of the whole of the land with the bricks and mortar.
					In the common division of brewery holdings&mdash;one-third Ordinary Shares, one-third Preference
					Shares, and one-third Debenture Stock&mdash;the investment work work out as follows: £3,333 6s. 8d.
					Ordinary Shares, £3,333 6s. 8d. Preference Shares, and £3,333 6s. 8d. Debenture Stock. With a time
					limit as proposed in the Government Bill the whole of the Ordinary Shares would disappear, the
					whole of the Preference Shares would disappear, and, accepting the mean valuation of the figure
					quoted, £1,183 6s. 8d. belonging to the Mortgage Debenture Stock holders would also be lost."</p>
					<p>It will be observed that Mr. Dupree, of the Portsmouth United Breweries (Limited) represents the
					value of this house as having been reduced to £2,150. I know nothing of the Coach and Horses, but
					the following telegram was sent on my behalf, reply paid, at one o'clock on Monday to the
					Portsmouth United Breweries, Portsmouth:</p>
					<p>"At what price would you sell the Coach and Horses and plot of land at Hilsea for? We have a
					client ready to offer £4,400 for prompt acceptance."</p>
					<p>No reply has been received to this telegram and my offer has, therefore, not received "prompt
					acceptance," although it amounted to more than double the sum to which the value was said to have
					been reduced. This makes an interesting warning as to trade figures during such a campaign.</p>
					<p>I many mention that what emboldened me to make this offer was my experience during the
					agitation of the trade which culminated in the Act of 1904. The cases of individual hardship
					which were at that time put forward with the greatest authority where the two which were cited by
					Sir Ralph Littler in an appeal which reached all Members of Parliament, and the two which were put
					forward by the leader of the trade deputation which waited upon Mr. Balfour. After an
					investigation into these cases, in which I was assisted by the Church of England Temperance Society,
					I offered to give £100 to any charity connected with the trade if either those cited by Sir Ralph
					Littler or those of the trade deputation were decided to be approximately correct by and judge of
					the High Court, after hearing at statement on each side.&mdash;Yours, &c.,</p>
					<p>A. CAMERON CORBETT.</p>

					<p>"PINK'S PICTORIAL"</p>
					<p>"What do you think of Pink's Pictorial?" asks the Editor of the new illustrated monthly
						magazine. We reply that it is a very creditable performance and a welcome addition to the local
						literature. It invades no one's field, and yet covers much ground of interest to the
						antiquarian, the historian, and the general student of men and things. In this number the first of
						a series of illustrated articles upon "Celebrated neighbours" is devoted to Mr. W. L. Wyllie, R.A.,
						there is a description of Cosham Fair, Government House, Portsmouth is pictured and described, the
						now more than ever famous "Coach and Horses" is shown, and the story of its sale retold, and a right
						of way greivance at Hayling Island is pictorially represented. For frontispiece there is an
						excellent portrait of the new Commander-in-Chief.</p>

					<p>MOTOR MISHAP AT HILSEA.</p>
					<p>Milton Lady taken to Hospital.</p>
					<p>There was a motor car accident a little distance from the "Coach and Horses," on the road to
					Cosham, this afternoon, as the result of which two ladies were thrown out, and one was rather badly
					cut about the face.</p>
					<p>Mrs. Kathleen Symons and Miss Kathleen Masters, of 5, Milton-road, Portsmouth, the former 61
					years of age, were being driven towards Cosham, when it is understood something went wrong with
					the steering gear, for the car ran into the bank by the side of the road, also coming in contact
					with a tramcar standard.</p>
					<p>The police motor ambulance was summoned, and conveyed the two ladies to the Royal Portsmouth
					Hospital. The elder (Mrs. Symons) as stated, sustained a serious cut on the side of her face,
					and was also suffering from shock. She was detained. Her companion was fortunately not hurt
					beyond being considerably shaken.</p>
